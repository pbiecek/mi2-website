MI² is a group of mathematicians and computer scientists that love to play with data.
We are spread between [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw) and [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl).

DataLab is our creative space, place in which we have workshops, seminars and some experiments. Feel free to jump in. Here we are forging new ideas, creating tools, solving problems, doing consulting and sharing our positive attitude.

#### Mission {-}

Machine learning is like atomic energy. **We develop leaders, skills, methods, tools and good practices so that predictive models can be deployed responsibly and sustainably**.

#### Vision {-}

MI² is a group of experts supporting global initiatives aimed at responsible and sustainable machine learning. We support the development of future leaders of responsible machine learning through internships, PhDs, postdoctoral fellowships and so on. We seek for research grants and business projects to conduct both scientific and applied research. We develop and maintain software and infrastructure necessary to build responsible and sustainable ML. We develop cooperation with international teams working on similar topics. We support companies to implement best practices related to responsible modelling in their operation. We conduct workshops and training on responsible predictive modelling.

### Przemysław Biecek {-}

<img src="images/przemek.jpg" >

My personal mission is to enhance human capabilities by supporting them through access to data-driven and knowledge-based predictions. I execute it by developing methods and tools for responsible machine learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence and reliable software engineering.

I work as an associate professor at [Warsaw University of Technology](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/) and the [University of Warsaw](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/). I graduated in software engineering and mathematical statistics and now work on model visualisation, explanatory model analysis, predictive modelling and data science for healthcare.  In 2016, I formed the research group MI² which develops methods and tools for predictive model analysis.

## Positions {-}

There are currently no open lab positions, but this page shall be updated with upcoming opportunities.

<img src="images/positions.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

In summer 2021, we opened a summer internship program for students motivated to work on challenging problems concerning automated machine learning, explainability, fairness, and visualization. 
It was over 2 months of creative work in exciting projects for 12 interns, some of which decided to continue their research in the lab. See you next summer!
